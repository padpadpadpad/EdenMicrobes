# EdenMicrobes

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **EdenMicrobes** is to document and track the progress of
the datasets and analyses related to microbes at the Eden Project.

## Outline

Outline the project here!

## Scripts

- **visualise_climate.R** looks at the data from the temperature and
  moisture probes that were placed in the habitats. Produces
  **temperature_moisture.png**.

## Datasets

We have sequencing datasets of the biomes contained in `data/sequencing`
and data from monitoring of abiotic variables present in `climate_data`.

- **Eden_GPS_data.csv** contains the GPS coordinates of each site. A
  breakdown of the columns are below:

  - Sample - Sample name that corresponds to a sequencing file and a
    sampling point.

  - Ecosystem - What ecosystem did the sample come from.

  - Diversity - Whether the sample has high or low plant diversity.

  - Biome - Which biome did the sample come from (Humid = rainforest,
    Dry = mediterranean).

### Sequencing data (in data/sequencing)

### Climate data (in data/climate)

- **Eden_microclimare**

- **Eden_soil_chem_data_nov23.csv** contains nutrient and chemical
  composition data for each sample. A breakdown of all the column names
  and their units is below:

  - Sample - Sample name that corresponds to a sequencing file and a
    sampling point.

  - Ecosystem - What ecosystem did the sample come from.

  - Diversity - Whether the sample has high or low plant diversity.

  - Biome - Which biome did the sample come from (Humid = rainforest,
    Dry = mediterranean).
